    FILL THE CODE
    Compute the Q values as ouput of the neural network.
    W1 and bias_W1 refer to the first layer
    W2 and bias_W2 refer to the second layer
    Use rectified linear units
    The output vectors of this function are Q and out1
    Q is the ouptut of the neural network: the Q values
    out1 contains the activation of the nodes of the first layer 
    there are othere possibilities, these are our suggestions
